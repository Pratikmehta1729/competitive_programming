Given an array A, containing n distinct integers, you need to seacrh an element x in the array and print reverse of element x. If the element doesn't exist then print "NE"
You will be given q queries to solve.

Constraints:
1 <= q <= 10^5
1 <= n <= 10^5
-2^63 <= A[i], x <= 2^63 - 1

Sample Input:
5
12 24 83 75 31
2
31 
45

Sample Output:
13
NE

Moli's mathematics teacher has given her a homework in which she has been given a list of "N" unique numbers and "Q" fuzzy numbers. Now, her task is to find a number A[i] from that list for each fuzzy number "X" in "Q" such that the binary sum of A[i] and the complement of "X" is a number whose all bits are set. 

As Moli has to submit her homework tommorow and she is weak in mathematics, she needs your help. Please help her with her homework.

Input:
*) First line contain an integer N
*) Next line contain Set of N numbers
*) Next line contain an integer Q i.e no of queries
*) Next Q lines will contain fuzzy numbers, one in each line.

Output:
For every X print "YES" if you find such a number in the list satisfying the above condition otherwise print "NO".


Constraints:
1 <= Q <= 10^5
1 <= N <= 10^5
-2^63 <= A[i], x <= 2^63 - 1, 1 <= i <= N
